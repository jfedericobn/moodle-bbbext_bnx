# BigBlueButton BN Experience

BigBlueButton BN Experience is a foundational UX enhancement extension for BigBlueButton in Moodle — featuring moderator approval workflows and shared capabilities that power the entire BNX extension family. Developed and supported by Blindside Networks, the creators of BigBlueButton.

## Description

This plugin extends the BigBlueButton activity module with foundational UX improvements and shared behaviours that can be reused by other `bbbext_bnx_*` sidecar plugins.

**Note:** This plugin is the parent for other `bbbext_bnx_*` extensions and must be enabled for those plugins to function.

## Features

- **Waiting Room (moderator approval before join)**: Replaces the built-in "Wait for Moderator" screen with a Waiting Room lobby. Participants wait until a moderator approves their entry — configurable site-wide with per-activity override for teachers.
- **Enhanced recording experience**: Replaces the core recordings table with a fully functional implementation including search, sorting, pagination, editable recording name and description, and recording import. Driven by dedicated AJAX web services.
- **Navigation label override**: Replaces the default BigBlueButton activity navigation label with "BigBlueButton +" to surface the enhanced experience to users.
- **Sidecar integration contract**: BNX publishes the `\bbbext_bnx\event\state_changed` event on every BNX enable/disable transition. Sidecar `bbbext_bnx_*` plugins subscribe to that event in their own `db/events.php` and decide for themselves how to react. BNX no longer auto-enables or auto-disables sibling sub-plugins; administrator intent on sibling enablement is always preserved (see [Sidecar contract](#sidecar-contract) below).
- **Backup and restore**: Full backup and restore support for per-activity settings.
- **GDPR Compliant**: No personal user data is stored (null privacy provider).

## Requirements

- Moodle 5.1 or later
- BigBlueButton plugin (`mod_bigbluebuttonbn`)

## Installation

1. Copy the plugin to `mod/bigbluebuttonbn/extension/bnx/`
2. Visit Site Administration > Notifications to complete installation
3. Configure settings at Site Administration > Plugins > Activity modules > BigBlueButton > BigBlueButton BN Experience

## Configuration

### Admin Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Waiting Room enabled by default | Default on/off state for the Waiting Room across all activities | Enabled |
| Allow teachers to change the Waiting Room setting per activity | Allow teachers to override the Waiting Room on or off for individual activities | Enabled |

### Per-Activity Settings

Teachers can configure this on the BigBlueButton activity form under **Room Settings +**:

- **Moderator approval required to join session**

When enabled, the plugin sets:
- `guestPolicy=ASK_MODERATOR` for `create`
- `guest=true` for `join`

## Architecture

### Key Classes

| Class | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `action_url_addons` | Injects guest policy parameters into BBB API calls |
| `mod_form_addons` | Adds the Waiting Room checkbox and per-activity fields to the activity form |
| `mod_instance_helper` | Handles per-activity settings storage |
| `action_url_parameters` | Computes create/join parameters based on settings |
| `view_page_addons` | Overrides the BBB view page to embed the enhanced recordings experience |
| `page_context_builder` | Builds the full template context for the view page |
| `hook_callbacks` | Injects the navigation label override on BigBlueButton module pages |
| `recording_helper` | Helpers for recording data retrieval and formatting |
| `joinurl_helper` | Builds custom join URLs |
| `guestlink_lookup` | Isolated shim for parent-table guest-link UID lookups (pending upstream `mod_bigbluebuttonbn\instance::get_from_guestlinkuid()`) |
| `sidecar_helper` | Utilities shared across BNX sidecar plugins |
| `state_changed` | Event triggered on BNX enable/disable transitions; the public sidecar integration contract |

### Web Services

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bbbext_bnx_get_meeting_info` | Returns meeting info with BNX extensions |
| `bbbext_bnx_get_recordings` | Returns recordings list for the enhanced recordings table |
| `bbbext_bnx_get_recordings_to_import` | Returns recordings available to import |

### API Integration

The plugin uses the `action_url_addons` hook to append parameters:

```php
// create
['guestPolicy' => 'ASK_MODERATOR']

// join
['guest' => 'true']
```

### Settings Resolution

1. If the Waiting Room setting is editable, the per-activity value is used.
2. Otherwise, the site-wide admin default is used.

## Sidecar contract

Starting with BNX **1.1.1**, the integration boundary between `bbbext_bnx` and
its sibling `bbbext_bnx_*` sub-plugins ("sidecars") is a public, event-driven
contract. BNX no longer reaches into sibling plugins' enablement, configuration,
or storage; sidecars opt in to BNX-driven behaviour through documented hooks.

This change brings BNX in line with the Moodle
[Component Communication policy](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/component-communication).

### What BNX guarantees

- **No auto-enablement.** BNX never calls `\core\plugininfo\mod::enable_plugin()`
  for `mod_bigbluebuttonbn` or for any sibling `bbbext_bnx_*` plugin. The
  administrator enables the parent module and each sidecar explicitly.
- **No cross-plugin writes.** BNX install/upgrade code mutates only BNX-owned
  tables and the `bbbext_bnx` config namespace.
- **No direct sibling-table reads.** Parent-table lookups are confined to
  `\bbbext_bnx\local\helpers\guestlink_lookup` and are tracked for removal
  once upstream `mod_bigbluebuttonbn` exposes a matching API
  (see Moodle tracker request for `instance::get_from_guestlinkuid()`).
- **A public event for state transitions.** Every BNX enable/disable transition
  emits `\bbbext_bnx\event\state_changed` with payload
  `other => ['enabled' => bool]`. Sidecars subscribe to this event if they want
  to mirror BNX state; sidecars that do not subscribe are unaffected.

### Event payload

```php
\bbbext_bnx\event\state_changed::create([
    'context' => \context_system::instance(),
    'other'   => ['enabled' => true],  // false on disable
])->trigger();
```

- `crud`: `'u'`
- `edulevel`: `LEVEL_OTHER`
- `other['enabled']`: `bool` (required) — `true` when BNX has just been enabled,
  `false` when BNX has just been disabled.

### Subscribing from a sidecar

A sidecar (e.g. `bbbext_bnx_mysidecar`) declares an observer in its own
`db/events.php`:

```php
// mod/bigbluebuttonbn/extension/mysidecar/db/events.php
$observers = [
    [
        'eventname' => \bbbext_bnx\event\state_changed::class,
        'callback'  => \bbbext_bnx_mysidecar\observer::class . '::bnx_state_changed',
        'internal'  => false,
    ],
];
```

and implements the observer:

```php
// mod/bigbluebuttonbn/extension/mysidecar/classes/observer.php
namespace bbbext_bnx_mysidecar;

class observer {
    public static function bnx_state_changed(\bbbext_bnx\event\state_changed $event): void {
        $enabled = (bool) $event->other['enabled'];
        // Mirror BNX state inside *this* sidecar only. Never touch other plugins.
        if ($enabled) {
            // ... enable sidecar-owned features ...
        } else {
            // ... disable sidecar-owned features ...
        }
    }
}
```

Sidecars that should remain enabled regardless of BNX state simply do not
subscribe. Each sidecar is responsible for its own enablement; BNX is not.

### Sidecar callback discovery

For non-state behaviour (e.g. presentation providers), BNX discovers sidecar
implementations by the `{pluginname}`-templated class-name convention enforced
by `\bbbext_bnx\local\helpers\sidecar_helper`. A sidecar that wants to provide
presentations exposes:

```
\bbbext_{pluginname}\local\helpers\presentation_helper::get_presentations_for_ws(int $instanceid): array
```

BNX iterates enabled sidecars, calls the method when present, and degrades to
an empty result when no sidecar provides it. The contract is conventional, not
typed; a future Moodle hook may replace it (tracker request filed).

## Privacy

This plugin **does not store any personal data**. It only stores configuration values and per-activity feature toggles.

## Version History

- **1.1.1** (June 1, 2026) — Open LMS code-review remediation. Introduces the
  public `\bbbext_bnx\event\state_changed` event and removes BNX-side
  auto-enable/auto-disable of sibling sub-plugins; administrators now manage
  each plugin's enablement explicitly. See [Sidecar contract](#sidecar-contract).
- **1.0** (March 11, 2026) — First stable open-source release. See [RELEASENOTES](RELEASENOTES) for full history.
